# BainsaReportProject

Our research project for Chaptr Global focuses on using predictive analytics to measure student outcomes accurately. Specifically, we aim to forecast a student's probability of gaining employment after graduation and their anticipated income based on their education and work experience before enrolling in an educational program.

To achieve our research goals, we utilize ML algorithms with which we analyze large datasets scraped from social media platforms. The data extraction process involves carefully organizing the collected data and subjecting it to comprehensive analysis to identify patterns and trends.

We have made significant progress in our research project by developing an efficient scraper based on an open-source project. With our scraper we are able to store data in binary files. Our plan is to automate it to acquire data in bulk, so we can expand our research.

Once we have gathered sufficient data, we will use it to build a predictive model that will hopefully accurately predict a student's probability of gaining employment and their expected income. Our research has the potential to revolutionize the way we measure student outcomes and provide valuable insights to educational institutions worldwide.
